* __Deep learning and neural networks were conceptualized decades ago, why are they only now taking off?__
  * Moore's law = more processing power and storage
  * The internet provided a preponderance of data to use
* Geoffrey Hinton, early leader in neural networks. Proposed modeling it after human brain.
  * 100 billion neurons in the brain
  * Each is connected to up to a 1000 of its neighbors.  Dense network with lots of connections.
  * In a deep learning neural network, we have input values, which is our dataset.  And we have some output or goal that are aiming towards (a prediction maybe or some creative output).  Deep learning tries to model our brain by creating lots and lots of "hidden" layers between the input and output, where the input data is connected to all kinds of other hidden nodes which ultimately are all connected and synthesize our output
